# Got Next
An iOS app built using SwiftUI to help you find pick-up basketball games near you

## Setup
To make change to this app, clone the repository and run `pod install`

## Backend
The backend API is written in Ruby on Rails and is available here: [https://github.com/jeffjxu/basketball-backend](https://github.com/jeffjxu/basketball-backend)

## Testing
Before running all tests, run testLoginSuccess() first because the API needs a warm up  
If a test fails, check for database conflict before running again
